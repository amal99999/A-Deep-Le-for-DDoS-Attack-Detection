# A-Deep-Le-for-DDoS-Attack-Detection
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid deep learning model combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in network traffic. The model achieves exceptional accuracy of 99.9954% with 30 epochs of training.
# Dataset
This implementation uses the CICDDoS2019 dataset, which contains benign and DDoS attack traffic data. The dataset includes various DDoS attack types and is widely used for evaluating DDoS detection systems.

# Objectives
* Develop a novel hybrid deep learning architecture combining GRU and BiLSTM for efficient DDoS attack detection.
* Analyze and compare the performance of individual GRU and BiLSTM models with the hybrid approach.
* Demonstrate the impact of training epochs on detection accuracy and false positive rates.
* Provide a computationally efficient solution for real-time DDoS attack detection.
